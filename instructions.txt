# Deployment Instructions for BuzzHeavier Image Uploader

## Prerequisites
- Vercel account
- Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

## Project Structure
```
project-root/
│
├── api/
│   └── upload.js          # Vercel serverless function
├── index.html             # Frontend HTML file
├── package.json           # Project dependencies
└── vercel.json            # Vercel configuration
```

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Create a New Project in Vercel**
   - Connect your GitHub/GitLab repository to Vercel
   - Ensure the project structure matches the one described above

2. **Vercel Configuration**
   Create a `vercel.json` file in your project root:
   ```json
   {
     "rewrites": [
       { "source": "/", "destination": "/index.html" }
     ],
     "functions": {
       "api/upload.js": {
         "maxDuration": 30
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Run the following command to install required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install axios form-data
   ```

4. **Environment Variables**
   - No additional environment variables are needed for this implementation
   - The Bearer token is hardcoded in the serverless function (consider using environment variables for added security in production)

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure all files are committed to your repository
- Check Vercel deployment logs for any errors
- Verify that the serverless function path is correct in Vercel settings

## Security Considerations
- Replace the hardcoded Bearer token with an environment variable
- Implement additional validation for uploaded files
- Consider adding file size and type restrictions

## Notes
- The frontend assumes the serverless function is deployed at `/api/upload`
- Modify the fetch URL if your deployment path differs
